Beta Wamali

Welcome to the Wamali!  This is all a bunch of bullshit that's getting worked on.  If you don't know what's up already, this is probably not a project that is ready for you yet, but since it's here, you can't hurt yourself looking around.

WARNING: THIS IS A DEVELOPMENTAL INFORMATION SET ABOUT A FIREARM AND ITS MANUFACTURE. None of this information is protected or classified, no warranty is made for it's accuracy. check your sources.  Currently, as of this writing (12-31-24) the wamali is safe to fire, but the bolt geometry modeled currently is partial/incomplete, and a development bolt is currently being built for a test firing for  what SHOULD finally yield a fully cycling functioning firearm: meanwhile, the "T" bolt version (as I am calling it) is the modeled version in the CAD file in this for now. You can amke one if you want, and you may even be able to round off the front face of an ar15 and get it cycling with this, but I want the bolt carrier to work with a standard USGI milspec ar15 fire control group, and so the bolt is undergoing a redesign as I write this.

"Wamali"?

"Bae Toa Ma Lae" is approximately how you say "WHASSUP" in Burmese.  For Twinky-eating americans, the correct way to render this is approximately "Beta Wamali", and this name was chosen because it was a fun play on "yet another printed gun beta".

What is this printed gun, and why does it exist?

This gun exists to correct what I see as a handful of fundamental flaws with the FGC. First, the FGC inherits a number of inferior gun mechanisms: it has an exterior buffer tube (nearly doubling the length it needs to be, to function), it has an external and mechanical ejector mechanism. The bolt is a kludge of epoxy, weighted prints, and hardware store springs. the pieces that the gun breaks into have some logical ordering, but it is not comprehensive, and these pieces are just free screwed together, and not wired along a common metal frame structure.

Most important of all, if you try to build an FGC in different parts of the world, you are confronted by a problem: the common hardware store components you can get are slightly different measurements all over the world, to reflect the varied nature of manufacture and the tolerances engineered into them in the modern world. The most important idea in the wamali is that the modeling is done in reference to a combination of a geometry and a data set of the measurements of each piece of hardware store component used in that geometry.  In other words, the whole gun is generated, relative to the size of the hardware store components- allowing not only easier printing and manufacturing, but for the guns to have commonly interchanged parts, at least between single models of wamali.

One of the first things I get asked is "so when is there going to be a XXX" version, where XXX is somebody's favorite gun component to not fuck with making themselves. For example, "when are you going to make a glock barrel version" and "when are you going to make an AR-9 barrel version" are both questions that have partial answers.

Currently, there are about 10-15 separate generational files of what have been "the wamali" in different iterations, and in this file pile, there have been mockups for glock barrel versions, ar9 barrel versions.... and many MANY other things.  Part of the problem has been that overloading the CAD files causes them to become much slower, and then these kinds of forks end up in dead ends of files that were not fully copied over to a new ground-up rebuild.
